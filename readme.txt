Helprace is a customer support help desk, customer community and knowledge base accessible through a feedback widget.

== Description ==

Helprace Feedback Tab & SSO plugin adds a feedback widget to your site and enables Single Sign On between your Wordpress site and Helprace portal.

Feedback Tab allows you to gather feedback anywhere on your website and understand how customers feel about your product and brand. 
If you have a WordPress site, you can finally connect with your site visitors, blog readers and engage them at the right time. Site visitors will be able to search your company's user portal, knowledge base, questions, ideas, problems and praise. They'll also be able to submit their own feedback or send emails directly to the Helprace [help desk](http://helprace.com/help-desk).

Enabling Single Sign On allows your Wordpress users to get logged in to your Helprace portal automatically when they login to your Wordpress site.
